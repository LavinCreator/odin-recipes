    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine parsley, 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, oregano, vinegar, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a medium bowl; mix chimichurri thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on a cutting board and remove backbone using kitchen shears. Press down on the breast with the heel of your hand to flatten. Loosen skin carefully and rub chimichurri underneath, distributing it evenly. Wrap chicken in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.</li>
        <li>Allow chicken to come to room temperature for no more than 1 hour before baking.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rub 1 teaspoon olive oil over chicken; season with salt and pepper. Place onion in a cast iron skillet. Pour chicken broth over onion. Place seasoned chicken on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Allow chicken to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
